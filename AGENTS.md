# AGENTS

This repository hosts **Sigma**, an open-source ESP32 "AI pin" project. The goal is to iterate quickly on hardware and firmware using LLM-driven tooling.

## Using Codex or other LLMs
- All contributions should keep this file updated if new prompts or agent workflows are added.
- Tasks for the assistant can be recorded in issues or pull requests. Link relevant prompts here for future reference.
- The recommended LLM endpoints are listed in `llms.txt`.

## Repository layout
- `firmware/` – PlatformIO project for the ESP32.
- `hardware/` – schematics and PCB files.
- `enclosure/` – OpenSCAD models for the case.
- `docs/` – additional documentation such as architecture and roadmap.

Feel free to expand this file with more detailed agent instructions as the project grows.
