# Hardware

This folder contains CAD files and reference diagrams for the Sigma S1
push‑to‑talk device. Models are written in OpenSCAD so you can tweak
dimensions as needed.

The enclosure includes cutouts for the button, microphone, speaker, battery,
USB-C port, and a small lanyard hole for attaching a strap.

- `cad/` – OpenSCAD models for 3D printing
- `stl/` – auto-generated STL exports

See [docs/sigma-s1-assembly.md](../docs/sigma-s1-assembly.md) for a full
