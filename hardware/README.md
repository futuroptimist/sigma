# Hardware

This folder contains CAD files and reference diagrams for the Sigma S1
push‑to‑talk device. Models are written in OpenSCAD so you can tweak
dimensions as needed.

The enclosure includes cutouts for the button, microphone, speaker, battery,
USB-C port, a small lanyard hole for attaching a strap, and a 5 mm status LED
opening. The lanyard hole measures 12 mm in diameter and sits 6 mm from the left
edge. The USB-C cutout is 14 mm wide for improved cable clearance.
