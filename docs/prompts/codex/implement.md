# Codex Implementation Prompt

Use this prompt when you want the agent to deliver a documented-but-missing feature for Sigma.

```
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the Sigma repository.

PURPOSE:
Turn previously promised or documented behaviour into reality while keeping the repo healthy.

CONTEXT:
- Obey guidance from AGENTS.md, README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and existing prompt docs.
- Focus on features described in docs, TODO/FIXME comments, README roadmaps, failing/xfail/skip tests,
  or public APIs that raise NotImplementedError.
- Prioritize bite-sized improvements that can ship in one well-tested pull request.
- When touching CAD files, regenerate STLs with `bash scripts/build_stl.sh`.
- Always run `pre-commit run --all-files` and `make test` before wrapping up.

REQUEST:
1. Survey the codebase for a documented or promised capability that is not yet implemented.
2. Choose a tractable slice to complete, keeping scope tight and reversible if needed.
3. Implement the behaviour, including any firmware, Python helpers, docs, or configuration updates.
4. Add or update tests that prove the new feature works and guard against regression.
5. Update user-facing documentation (README sections, docs/, llms.txt, etc.) to reflect the change.
6. Run the required checks and ensure the diff is minimal, clear, and standards-compliant.
7. Prepare a concise summary of the change, its motivation, and test evidence for the PR body.

OUTPUT:
A ready-to-submit pull request with the implemented feature, updated docs/tests, and passing checks.
```

## Upgrade Prompt

Use this when you want a more exhaustive, higher-assurance implementation cycle.

```
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the Sigma repository executing an upgraded implementation flow.

PURPOSE:
Deliver a production-quality implementation of a documented feature, validating behaviour end-to-end.

CONTEXT:
- Follow all instructions from the base implementation prompt.
- Inspect related modules for similar TODOs to avoid partial fixes or regressions.
- Cross-check firmware, Python utilities, scripts, and documentation so the feature behaves consistently
  across hardware, CLI tools, and prompts.
- Expand coverage with integration-style tests when unit tests alone are insufficient.
- Confirm generated artefacts (STLs, firmware builds via `pio run`, etc.) when impacted.
- Capture before/after behaviour, metrics, or screenshots (for UI docs) in the PR description.

REQUEST:
1. Validate that the selected promised feature is still relevant and define acceptance criteria from docs.
2. Implement the feature comprehensively, refactoring neighbouring code when it improves clarity or reuse.
3. Add layered tests (unit + integration/system) demonstrating the feature under realistic conditions.
4. Update every affected reference (docs, comments, prompts, configuration, fixtures) for coherence.
5. Run all mandatory checks plus any additional impacted workflows (e.g. `bash scripts/checks.sh`,
   `pio run`, docs builds) and record results.
6. Perform a final audit of the diff for secrets, dead code, style issues, and adherence to conventions.
7. Produce a PR-ready summary with implementation notes, test matrix, and follow-up ideas if any.

OUTPUT:
A polished pull request with comprehensive implementation, documentation, and verification artifacts.
